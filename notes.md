# Simple Emailer App




## TODO
* configuration for sending to mailgun or sendgrid
* document the methods
* test install and usage by trying it out on imac
* add to readme:
** how to install
* ensure testability
* how to handle errors?
** e.g. 



## Design Notes
* method for validation of incoming data
* method for conversion of html
* method to send the email
** abstract out the configuration part...
** perhaps a factory class to create a mail-sender
* method to get auth of email stuff
* start with simple html frontend




## Notes to include in the readme
* I would have normally spent more time converting the body to plain text to make the email a bit nicer.
