# Simple Emailer App




## TODO
* test install and usage by trying it out on other computer
* add to readme:
** how to install
** how to include api keys


## Notes to include in the readme
* I would have normally spent more time converting the body to plain text to make the email a bit nicer, but new lines were simple to use and make the body at least a bit more human readable
* I didn't spend any time styling the front end, since appearance is not what we're going for here.
* to run the unit tests:
** npm i
** ./node_modules/.bin/jest
* I don't often create new projects from scratch. I would have preferred not to use javascript, but also wanted to get it moving quickly and express is the framework I am most familiar with for starting from scratch
* I would have preferred to add a logger if I had more time.
* For the internal code, I did not add much documentation. I believe that well named methods and variables help reduce the chance of stale comments. I also recognize this is not always the most accepted position and am willing to change my position if I hear a good argument otherwise.
